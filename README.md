# Practice-Coding

Hello visitor!

Find here some of the questions I have solved from the Cracking the Coding Interview book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell and from HackerRank.
Each file contains the question, the question number from the book and my solution.
I would appreciate if you can leave some feedback on how I can improve my coding style/skills.
Thank you for visiting.

Peace,
Tuan
